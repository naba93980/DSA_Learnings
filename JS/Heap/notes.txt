Insertion in heap:

Step 1: Insert the new element at the next available position (the bottom of the heap).

Step 2: Compare the newly inserted element with its parent. If the newly inserted element has a higher priority (in a max-heap) or a lower priority (in a min-heap) than its parent, swap them.

Step 3: Repeat step 2 until the heap property is satisfied or until the new element reaches the root of the heap.


Deletion in heap:

Step 1: Remove the root element (the element with the highest priority in a max-heap) and replace it with the last element in the heap (usually the rightmost element in the bottom level).

Step 2: "Bubble down" the new root element by comparing it with its children and swapping it with the child that has a higher priority (in a max-heap) or a lower priority (in a min-heap) until the heap property is satisfied.

everything is walk
a open walk is trail - no edges repeated
a open walk is path - no edges AND vertices repeated
a closed path - starting and ending vertex same - is a cycle


types of graph - 
undirected. directed, bidirectional, null graph, 
connected, disconnected(node), self-loop,
weighted, unweighted

ways to represent graph - adjacency list, adjacency matrix

a ----------b                   
 |          /   |
 |      /       |
 |   /          |
c              d

adjacency matrix representtion - 

0 1 1 0
1 0 1 1
1 1 0 0
0 1 0 0

adjacency list representtion - 

a -> [b,c]
b -> [a,c,d]
c -> [a,b]
c -> [b]
